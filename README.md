# Task 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM) - AI & ML Internship

## ðŸ§  Objective
To build and evaluate linear and non-linear SVM classifiers using the Breast Cancer dataset.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
Used the Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn with 2 selected features for 2D visualization.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## âœ… Steps Performed
1. Loaded and preprocessed dataset.
2. Normalized features for optimal SVM performance.
3. Trained SVM with both linear and RBF kernel.
4. Visualized decision boundaries in 2D.
5. Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
6. Evaluated model using confusion matrix and classification report.

## ðŸ§ª Results
- Accuracy improved after hyperparameter tuning.
- RBF kernel performed better on non-linear boundaries.

## ðŸ¤” What I Learned
- Margin maximization and the role of support vectors.
- How kernel trick allows SVM to classify non-linear data.
- Importance of tuning `C` and `gamma` using cross-validation.
